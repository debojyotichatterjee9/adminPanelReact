## React Admin Panel Example

#Recently I came across a blog post about React Admin Panel and I was pretty amazed to see how quickly you can build an admin panel with some necessary functionalities.

#So, I created this example real quick to see how this works and also can help others to get a  readymade implementation of an Admin Panel.

In the project directory, you can run:

## `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.<br>
If you have any other process running on the same port it will ask you if you want to run the project on a different port

**The rest of the npm scripts are same as available by default**

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

**You can see a working example of the project here:*
