## React Admin Panel Example

###### Recently I came across a blog post about React Admin Panel and I was pretty amazed to see how quickly you can build an admin panel with some necessary functionalities.

###### So, I created this example real quick to see how this works and also can help others to get a  readymade implementation of an Admin Panel.

###### In the project directory, you can run:

## `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.<br>
**If you have any other process running on the same port it will ask you if you want to run the project on a different port.**

The rest of the npm scripts are same as available by default

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

**You can see a working example of the project here:*

### The default login screen
###### If you are cloning this project you can use any UserID and Password combination to access and it will be stored in your local storage.

### This is the view of the Admin Panel with CRUD operations, export to CSV, pagination and reordering functionality.
